<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name: group 33 (Matthew Nielsen,....... ,....... )</strong> ...</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The primary goal is to increase the size of audiences attending Barrier Reef Orchestra performances. Secondarily,
    to increase the number of Barrier Reef Orchestral supporters and members.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Growth in audience numbers can be measured by the number of redirects to ticketshop or event signup page. Redirects
        to ticketshop or signup pages indicates a user has transferred from "interested" to seeking out a
        spot for attendance.
    </li>
    <li>Growth in memberships can be measured by the amount of people signing up to the membership page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>


<p>Younger people - who have little difficulty attending events - who have an interest in music, orchestras or
    attending orchestral events.
</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The website will feature concise, simplified text elements towards the front regions of the website. The display
        volume will ease into more detailed pages towards the back and side regions of the website.
        This is designed to avoid an information overload, and to keep website audiences focused on potentially becoming
        Barrier Reef Orchestral audiences, as opposed to simply absorbing broader information.
    </li>
    <li>The website will be designed with a colour scheme (balance of light and dark colours)
        that conveys a non-intimidating atmosphere.
        The purpose of this is to make the website appeal to audiences that
        might forgo a night at the orchestra, due to a belief that orchestras are overly formal events.
    </li>
    <li>The website will primarily use big, bold and enthusiastic pictures, to convey a sense of excitement to viewers.
    Specifically, photos of attendees and members alluding to a sense of glitz or glamor, will be prioritized over more
        rigid and formal photos.</li>
    <li>The website will employ a centered, responsive web design,
        with padding elements and white space utilized on the edges.
    This is designed to insure compatibility with as many devices as possible. Specifically mobile devices,
        which are an important tool for reaching young and wide audiences.</li>
