Client.

The Barrier Reef Orchastra.

- been around for 16 years. Started by a group of locals who felt that it would be good for JCU students to have a real orchestra to play with (instrumental program now defunct)
Program has endured because of community based interest (largely fueled by many different musical teachers).

- caters to Upper-class and casual audiences (depending on the played event).

- ranges All ages. (year 8 to 73).

- diverse member pool, thus diverse requirements for audience.

- people wanting to find out about music and Townsvilles own orhcastra.

- play mostly classical / light-classical music.

-- possible links - families of instruments (possible link); whistle clunk and boom; getting to know instruments.

--- Likely links - Facebook (Barrier Reef Orchestra)

- 4 major groups - toot (trumpets) whistle (flutes) plunk (violin strings), boom (percussion).

-- negatives of the old website - too much print on front pages.

# Australian concerto prize award (susually for soloists). Get oppurtunity to play with orchastra.

# Conductors are often brought in from outside of the city..... Orchastra believes intrest from outside conductors is a feather in their cap / noteworthy.

# members of orchastra often collected from the community. Client feels upperclass / noteworthy.
